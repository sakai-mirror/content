<h2>Viewing metadata of an item in Resources</h2>
<p>When you look at a site's Resources, within the Resources window you
will see the Title, Size, author ("Created By"), and Last Modified
date.</p>

<p>If you have sufficient permissions, you can click <strong><code>Edit</code></strong> to
revise a Resource item, at which time you can also see Creation Time
and Last Modified By metadata.</p>

<p>To view a Resource folder's subfolders, click the plus sign
(<code>+</code>) on the folder icon left of the title. You can toggle
the folder open and closed by clicking the plus sign or minus sign
(<code>-</code>). If the folder icon has an arrow on it, it is too
large to be expanded.</p>
