<h2>Viewing and opening files in Resources</h2>

<p>When you click <strong><code>Resources</code></strong> in the <a href="content.hlp?docId=arcc">menubar</a>, you will
see a list of the site's resources and folders containing
resources. You can then do the following to browse through the
available material:</p>

<ul><li>To view a resource, click the name of the resource, or the icon
next to it. You may need to agree to a copyright statement, and then
you will see the resource.

<br /><br />
</li><li>To view the contents of a folder, click the folder icon next to
the folder name or the name itself to open it, or click the black
arrows to the left of "Title" to expand all the folders (i.e., make
their contents visible).

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can navigate between resources and folders using the
"Location:" path above the resource list; simply click a folder name
in the path to go to that folder. You can also click the icon of a
folder with an arrow in it to go up one level.

<br /><br />
</li><li>You can sort the resources by title (click <strong><code>Title</code></strong>),
resource creator (click <strong><code>Created by</code></strong>), date last modified
(click <strong><code>Modified</code></strong>), or size (click <strong><code>Size</code></strong>). To reverse
the order, click any of these links again.

</li></ul>
