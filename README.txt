This branch includes new features that will be used in production 
at Boston University, Whitman College, UVISA and possibly other 
institutions beginning in late August 2006, once they complete QA.  
The new features (ability to hide resources from most users and 
ability to schedule release and retraction of resources) will be 
part of sakai_2.3.

For now, this branch is based on Sakai 2.2.0 because that is 
already a known quantity.  By the time the QA cycle is done, 
we expect it will be based on Sakai 2.2.1,
