1. What's New

  1.1. Enhancements

    1.1.1. Group Awareness

   Group awareness has been extended to three additional tools: Resources,
   Assignments, and Schedule. That is to say, the contents of each of those
   tools can have their access restricted to specific groups, as they are
   defined by site maintainers in the Site Info tool.

    1.1.2. EID/UID Separation

   For the last few releases we've been working to introduce the concept of
   "internal" and "external" identifiers in Sakai in the user records. We
   started with a single identifier that had to play both of these roles, and
   have been tweaking the code to separate these out. For 2.2 we have
   completed this separation. It is now possible for an institution to, for
   example, alter the enterprise IDs of their users without losing access to
   their sites and materials in Sakai. For a thorough discussion of these
   changes, see the doc reference/docs/architecture/sakai_id_eid.doc (or in
   subversion at:
   https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference/branches/sakai_2-2-x/docs/architecture/sakai_id_eid.doc)

    1.1.3. FCKeditor

   The FCKeditor WYSIWYG editor was available in 2.1, but not the default. In
   2.2 it has become the default editor. HTMLArea is still included, however,
   and the default editor may be overridden in sakai.properties by altering
   the following setting:

 # specify the wysiwyg editor
 wysiwyg.editor=FCKeditor

    1.1.4. Included Skins

   The three highest-scoring skins from the recent skins contest have been
   included in the distribution. You can make any of these your default skin
   by using the following property in sakai.properties (other possible values
   are commented out in the example below):

 # The default skin for sites without a skin setting
 # skin.default=gen-u
 # skin.default=examp-u
 # skin.default=some-u
 skin.default=default

    1.1.5. Updated Help Content

   Help content in 2.1 was out of date, reflecting only version 2.0 of the
   software. The help content has been updated for 2.2, along with some style
   improvements. To see the ongoing work of the Help project, visit their
   space in Confluence:

   http://bugs.sakaiproject.org/confluence/display/HELP/Home

    1.1.6. French and Japanese translations

   New interface translations for French and Japanese have been included. See
   reference/docs/readme_i18n.txt for more information on the translations.

  1.2. New Tools

   Sakai 2.2.0 has added four new provisional tools

   Message Center   a tool combining a discussion forum with private
                    messaging.
   Search           a tool providing a Google-like search of all site
                    content.
   Summary Calendar a synoptic calendar view for the MyWorkspace that
                    includes events from all the sites to which a user is a
                    member.
   Post 'Em         an automated reporting system that enables faculty to
                    post grades and comments without compromising student
                    privacy. Post `Em accepts CSV files, empowering faculty
                    to track student grades in a spreadsheet application of
                    their choice.

   You can find more details about these and all other provisional tools on
   the provisional tools page.

2. Migration Issues

  2.1. Database Conversion

   There are database schema changes between 2.1.2 and 2.2.0, and the
   conversion scripts to be applied - in distinct versions for MySQL and
   Oracle, respectively - are found in the reference/docs/conversion folder
   of the release or on subversion:

MySQL:  https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference/branches/sakai_2-2-x/docs/conversion/sakai_2_1_2-2_2_0_mysql_conversion.sql
Oracle: https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference/branches/sakai_2-2-x/docs/conversion/sakai_2_1_2-2_2_0_oracle_conversion.sql

   In the same directory you'll also find conversion scripts for earlier
   Sakai versions. Migration from an earlier version will require the
   successive application of all intermediate conversion scripts. You cannot,
   for example, move from 2.1.1 to 2.2.0 by applying a single DB script. You
   will need to move first from 2.1.1 to 2.1.2, and then to 2.2.0.

  Examine before using

   As a general rule, be sure to read through these conversion scripts before
   applying them. They do not take into account any special customizations
   you may have made - such as new roles, or the deployment of additional
   tools - and they may complicate your migration with unintended
   consequences if you execute the script blindly.

   For the 2.2.0 release, the Message Center tool offers one such particular
   example. A number of schools deployed Message Center in 2.1.x production,
   before it was yet a provisional tool. Now that it is a provisional tool,
   the conversion scripts were written to introduce its tables, and thus
   assume that Message Center is a new tool for your deployment. If it isn't,
   you'll want to comment out the portions of the conversion script that
   treat it, and instead perform the following conversions:

   MySQL:  ALTER TABLE MFR_TOPIC_T ADD DEFAULTASSIGNNAME VARCHAR(255);
          ALTER TABLE MFR_OPEN_FORUM_T ADD DEFAULTASSIGNNAME VARCHAR(255);
          ALTER TABLE MFR_MESSAGE_T ADD GRADEASSIGNMENTNAME VARCHAR(255);
          ALTER TABLE MFR_MESSAGE_T ADD GRADECOMMENT VARCHAR(255);
          
   Oracle: ALTER TABLE MFR_TOPIC_T ADD DEFAULTASSIGNNAME VARCHAR2(255) NULL;
          ALTER TABLE MFR_OPEN_FORUM_T ADD DEFAULTASSIGNNAME VARCHAR2(255) NULL;
          ALTER TABLE MFR_MESSAGE_T ADD GRADEASSIGNMENTNAME VARCHAR2(255) NULL;
          ALTER TABLE MFR_MESSAGE_T ADD GRADECOMMENT VARCHAR2(255) NULL;

  2.2. Framework Changes

   The 2.2 refactoring means that many package names have changed, and these
   differences will mainly be encountered in sakai.properties settings with
   bean references. It's best to not try to use a sakai.properties from a
   previous release, and instead start with the sample in
   reference/docs/sakai.properties.

   Any custom code, such as providers, may also need revision. See below for
   more discussion of providers in particular.

  2.3. Provider Changes

   As mentioned above, 2.2 introduces a separation of external user
   identifiers from Sakai's internal user ids. Any custom
   UserDirectoryProvider will need some alteration to account for this, along
   with changes to its import statements and declarations that stem from API
   changes. Below is a list of changes that a typical provider should
   require:

    1. Import statements altered to reflect new package names.

    2. A search and replace to turn getters and setters from, e.g., 'getId'
       to 'getEid'.

    3. Revise the project.xml files in both the provider module and
       'component' with the appropriate UDP location.

    4. Change the Spring bean declaration in component.xml.

    5. The UDP class may implement the DisplayAdvisorUDP interface
       (optional), and the two additional methods this pulls in.

   Be sure to review the SampleUserDirectoryProvider, and compare it against
   the same sample for previous releases:

   https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/providers/branches/sakai_2-2-x/sample/src/java/org/sakaiproject/provider/user/SampleUserDirectoryProvider.java

  2.4. Skin Changes

   A number of CSS changes will need to be made to any 2.1 skins in order to
   adapt them to 2.2. These changes - including conversion steps - are
   thoroughly documented in the appendices of the skin document available in
   reference/docs/architecture, or in subversion at:
   https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/reference/branches/sakai_2-2-x/docs/architecture/sakai_skin.doc

3. Maintenance Branch

   The code of each release has a corresponding maintenance branch, which is
   patched with fixes in an ongoing way by a branch manager - effectively
   until there is no longer sufficient interest in it for a branch manager to
   volunteer. Maintenance branches therefore represent the latest stable
   snapshot of any given Sakai version.

   These maintenance branches may be checked out through subversion, they are
   labeled with an 'x' replacing their minor version number, e.g. '2-2-x'.
   You can check out the 2.2 maintenance branch with the following command:

   svn co https://source.sakaiproject.org/svn/sakai/branches/sakai_2-2-x/
